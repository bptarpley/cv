                    I played pivotal roles in two major campus-wide initiatives. The first was to
                    engineer a self-service portal for faculty, students, and staff to use to transition
                    their “Zimbra” email inboxes, calendars, and “briefcases” to Google cloud
                    services; specifically Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. This involved
                    creating a performant, enterprise grade web application with an asynchronous job
                    queue. With this application we were able to migrate over 50,0000 Zimbra
                    accounts, and our team was awarded “Team of the Semester” by TAMU
                    Computing and Information Services. The second major initiative was carried out
                    chiefly by me, and it involved developing “TAMUDirect,” which was another
                    enterprise web application that allowed faculty to access and configure Google
                    Group mailing lists for all of their courses.

                    The CLO makes available the
                    collected letters and photographs of Thomas and Jane Carlyle, providing
                    interfaces to browse, search, and explore them. This project came to me as
                    an admirable yet unsustainable boutique web application. Thankfully
                    project data was almost entirely TEI encoded. I wrote logic to extract TEI
                    data into Corpora. Much like TAP and MELP above, I wrote a custom
                    Wordpress plugin to query the Corpora API and present the data, matching
                    the legacy application’s appearance. Over time, I also implemented an
                    advanced search feature which queries and presents search results obtained

                    over time across major editions, and scholarly commentary of every
                    Shakespeare play. Excepting some initial HTML/CSS development, my
                    role has been to engineer the entirety of the digital NVS, from the
                    ingestion tasks that extract data from TEI encoded volumes to the
                    presentation of that data via the web-based variorum and paratext viewers.
                    The variorum viewer is an extremely complicated undertaking, involving
                    reconstructing synthetic play lines based on the original textual editorial
                    notations of variants, the construction of a histogram visualization of
                    changes over time across editions, the highlighting of commentary
                    lemmata, and many other ongoing challenges, including the construction
                    of backend tools for the creation of future NVS editions. Everything
                    pertaining to the digital NVS, from the backend to the frontend, is hosted

                    institutions. My role, as principal investigator for Texas A&M’s

                    exploring the LINCS dataset. Both of these objectives were accomplished

                    OCR tasks on the Brazos Supercomputing Cluster. This eventually entailed a
                    complete rewrite of the software, culminating in the basis for Corpora. This
                    allowed the Primeros Libros team to perform OCR on every printed volume
                    published in the Americas before 1601 using cutting edge neural network

        <h2>Pedagogy</h2>
        <p>I have two years of experience teaching a 4/4 load of undergraduate composition and literature survey courses as an Adjunct in the Department of English at Stephen F. Austin State University, and an additional year of teaching similar courses as a Graduate Assistant Teacher at Texas A&M University.</p>
        <p>I have seven years of experience teaching Python to humanists through the Programming for Humanists continuing education program at the Center of Digital Humanities Research at Texas A&M University. This involved teaching a hybrid course (both in-person and online, both synchronous and asynchronous) where I provided weekly 2-hour sessions of lecturing, live coding, and troubleshooting for up to a semester at a time. These courses were centered around humanities applications of Python, including things like Natural Language Processing, parsing and extracting data from XML, creating an OCR pipeline, querying API's, etc.</p>
